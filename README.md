## Built With üõ†
- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) - First class and official programming language for Android development. Our app is totally written in kotlin.
- [Different Layouts](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/declaring-layout) -  In this app we have used difrenet layouts to make the app UI responsive. The used layouts are LinearLayout, ConstraintLayout and FrameLayout .
- [Room](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room)-The Room persistence library provides an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow fluent database access while harnessing the full power of SQLite.
- [Android Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture) - Collection of libraries that help you design robust, testable, and maintainable apps.
  - [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) - Stores UI-related data that isn't destroyed on UI changes. 
  - [Navigation](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation#:~:text=Navigation%20refers%20to%20the%20interactions,bars%20and%20the%20navigation%20drawer.) - Navigation refers to the interactions that allow users to navigate across, into, and back out from the different pieces of content within your app. In our app we followed single app architecture using navigation and also implemented an unique nav nav drawer.
  - [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata) - LiveData is an observable data holder class. Unlike a regular observable, LiveData is lifecycle-aware, meaning it respects the lifecycle of other app components, such as activities, fragments, or services.
- [Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html) - For asynchronous and more. Speacially used at the time of networking calls and using database .
- [Dependency Injection](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection) - 
  - [Hilt-Dagger](https://dagger.dev/hilt/) - Standard library to incorporate Dagger dependency injection into an Android application.
  - [Hilt-ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-jetpack) - DI for injecting `ViewModel`.
- [Retrofit](https://github.com/square/retrofit) - A type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java.
- [RecyclerView](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/layout/recyclerview?authuser=2) - RecyclerView makes it easy to efficiently display large sets of data. To show large lists.
- [Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide.git) - Glide is a fast and efficient open-source media management and image loading framework for Android developed by bumptech. In this tutorial, we will use this awesome library to show an image from the internet on our apps screen.
- [MVVM](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/guide) - MVVM is one of the architectural patterns which enhances separation of concerns, it allows separating the user interface logic from the business (or the back-end) logic. Its target (with other MVC patterns goal) is to achieve the following principle ‚ÄúKeeping UI code simple and free of app logic in order to make it easier to manage‚Äù.
- [SharedPreferences](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/shared-preferences) - If you have a relatively small collection of key-values that you'd like to save, you can use the SharedPreferences APIs. A SharedPreferences object points to a file containing key-value pairs and provides simple methods to read and write them. Each SharedPreferences file is managed by the framework and can be private or shared.
- [Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide.git) - Glide is a fast and efficient open-source media management and image loading framework for Android developed by bumptech. In this tutorial, we will use this awesome library to show an image from the internet on our apps screen.
